# testToken
The main code can be found on the master branch.

This is a project to deploy ERC20 tesTokens to the Binance Smart Chain.

I have used Truffle and Ganache for the project and tested using chai library.

1) You can find the smart contracts in the contracts folder.
2) The test folder will contain the test files.

The deployed Smart contract transaction hash is 0x4e420173a4270c0793a5dbe003dc22cc22e50752beaf6453f8f7f3152f84f721.

You can find the details on [bscscan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/tx/0x4e420173a4270c0793a5dbe003dc22cc22e50752beaf6453f8f7f3152f84f721).

Also, the deployed testToken total supply and transactions can be found [here](https://testnet.bscscan.com/token/0x10396f8fbf9902d3063910ee6ed0e75212ecc891).
